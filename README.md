Gaza Health Center

About Us

We are a dedicated team working on the Gaza Health Center (GHC) project, a digital healthcare platform designed to provide medical assistance in Gaza. Due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis, access to healthcare services has become extremely challenging. Our mission is to develop an online health center that offers medical consultations, mental health support, and essential healthcare resources for the people of Gaza.

Why This Project Matters
With limited access to hospitals and medical facilities due to war and restrictions, Gaza's residents struggle to receive proper healthcare. GHC is our contribution to providing an alternative digital solution that helps patients connect with doctors and receive guidance without requiring physical hospital visits.

🚀 This project is more than just a software system—it is a lifeline for those in need. We are committed to making a meaningful impact through technology.
